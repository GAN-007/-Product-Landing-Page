Intellectual property – the license agreement needs to cover the details of the intellectual property, including what is on offer as part of the licensing agreement. If any aspects of the intellectual property are not covered as part of the license agreements, you will need to ensure that this is expressed clearly in the document.
Purpose – your license agreements should cover the purpose for issuing rights to use the intellectual property. In other words, this section should detail why the license is needed and how the property can be used by the licensee.
Timelines and duration – when writing license agreements, make sure you include information about the term and duration for the agreement to remain active. You should also include information about whether there’s potential for the agreement to be extended past the agreed duration.
Termination – all license agreements should cover the termination of the contract, including what will happen if the contract is terminated and factors that might lead to the termination.
